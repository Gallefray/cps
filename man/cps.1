NAME
    cps - check process is running

SYNOPSIS
    cps INTERVAL[UNIT] PROCESS COUNT

DESCRIPTION
    Check that PROCESS is running every time INTERVAL has elapsed
    for COUNT times. If COUNT is 0 then cps will run infinitely.

    TIME is the amount of alloted time to wait before rechecking,
    and can be given a optional suffix of UNIT, where UNIT is 
    anything in [s|m|h|d] (meaning seconds, minutes, hours and
    days, respectively). If nothing is given, then UNIT
    defaults to seconds.
  
    For example, `cps 40 foo 4` would check every 40 seconds
    to see if the process named `foo` is running, for a 
    maximum of 4 times.
   
    If PROCESS terminates and cps is still running, cps will
    exit.
